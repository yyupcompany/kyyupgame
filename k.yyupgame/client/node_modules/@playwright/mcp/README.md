## Playwright MCP

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides browser automation capabilities using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev). This server enables LLMs to interact with web pages through structured accessibility snapshots, bypassing the need for screenshots or visually-tuned models.

### Key Features

- **Fast and lightweight**. Uses Playwright's accessibility tree, not pixel-based input.
- **LLM-friendly**. No vision models needed, operates purely on structured data.
- **Deterministic tool application**. Avoids ambiguity common with screenshot-based approaches.

### Requirements
- Node.js 18 or newer
- VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop, Goose or any other MCP client

<!--

node utils/generate-links.js

### Getting started

First, install the Playwright MCP server with your client.

**Standard config** works in most of the tools:

```js
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### User profile

You can run Playwright MCP with persistent profile like a regular browser (default), in isolated contexts for testing sessions, or connect to your existing browser using the browser extension.

**Persistent profile**

All the logged in information will be stored in the persistent profile, you can delete it between sessions if you'd like to clear the offline state.
Persistent profile is located at the following locations and you can override it with the `--user-data-dir` argument.

```bash
# Windows
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\ms-playwright\mcp-{channel}-profile

# macOS
- ~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/mcp-{channel}-profile

# Linux
- ~/.cache/ms-playwright/mcp-{channel}-profile
```

**Isolated**

In the isolated mode, each session is started in the isolated profile. Every time you ask MCP to close the browser,
the session is closed and all the storage state for this session is lost. You can provide initial storage state
to the browser via the config's `contextOptions` or via the `--storage-state` argument. Learn more about the storage
state [here](https://playwright.dev/docs/auth).

```js
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--isolated",
        "--storage-state={path/to/storage.json}"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Browser Extension**

The Playwright MCP Chrome Extension allows you to connect to existing browser tabs and leverage your logged-in sessions and browser state. See [extension/README.md](extension/README.md) for installation and setup instructions.

### Initial state

There are multiple ways to provide the initial state to the browser context or a page.

For the storage state, you can either:
- Start with a user data directory using the `--user-data-dir` argument. This will persist all browser data between the sessions.
- Start with a storage state file using the `--storage-state` argument. This will load cookies and local storage from the file into an isolated browser context.

For the page state, you can use:

- `--init-page` to point to a TypeScript file that will be evaluated on the Playwright page object. This allows you to run arbitrary code to set up the page.

```ts
// init-page.ts
export default async ({ page }) => {
  await page.context().grantPermissions(['geolocation']);
  await page.context().setGeolocation({ latitude: 37.7749, longitude: -122.4194 });
  await page.setViewportSize({ width: 1280, height: 720 });
};
```

- `--init-script` to point to a JavaScript file that will be added as an initialization script. The script will be evaluated in every page before any of the page's scripts.
This is useful for overriding browser APIs or setting up the environment.

```js
// init-script.js
window.isPlaywrightMCP = true;
```

### Configuration file

The Playwright MCP server can be configured using a JSON configuration file. You can specify the configuration file
using the `--config` command line option:

```bash
npx @playwright/mcp@latest --config path/to/config.json
```

### Standalone MCP server

When running headed browser on system w/o display or from worker processes of the IDEs,
run the MCP server from environment with the DISPLAY and pass the `--port` flag to enable HTTP transport.

```bash
npx @playwright/mcp@latest --port 8931
```

And then in MCP client config, set the `url` to the HTTP endpoint:

```js
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8931/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

<details>
<summary><b>Docker</b></summary>

**NOTE:** The Docker implementation only supports headless chromium at the moment.

```js
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "--init", "--pull=always", "mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Or If you prefer to run the container as a long-lived service instead of letting the MCP client spawn it, use:

```
docker run -d -i --rm --init --pull=always \
  --entrypoint node \
  --name playwright \
  -p 8931:8931 \
  mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/mcp \
  cli.js --headless --browser chromium --no-sandbox --port 8931
```

The server will listen on host port **8931** and can be reached by any MCP client.  

You can build the Docker image yourself.

```
docker build -t mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/mcp .
```

<details>
<summary><b>Programmatic usage</b></summary>

```js
import http from 'http';

import { createConnection } from '@playwright/mcp';
import { SSEServerTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/sse.js';

http.createServer(async (req, res) => {
  // ...

  // Creates a headless Playwright MCP server with SSE transport
  const connection = await createConnection({ browser: { launchOptions: { headless: true } } });
  const transport = new SSEServerTransport('/messages', res);
  await connection.connect(transport);

  // ...
});
